# Traveling ✈️
Here's a simple project of a travel agency website developed to exercise some basic skills. It was inspire on Isadora Stangarlin's tutorial videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOUrDmh7c7mVzTETBVBerrMawaLd-4RMs)

cool things about it:
- It was build only with HTML and CSS, showing that the basics still can do a good work;

- It is responsive, so some elements design were adapted to work better for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
